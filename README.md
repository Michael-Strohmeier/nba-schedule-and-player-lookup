# nba-schedule-and-player-lookup

data scraped from:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_NBA_team_rosters
  - https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_games-october.html

so far you can lookup a player and find the team they are on
  - player -> team

and lookup a team and find the teams schedule
  - team -> schedule

you don't need the players full name to do the lookup.

TODO:
  - clean the data
  - don't show games that have already been player (only future and present games)
  - GUI
    - so you can see roster with player measurements and stuff
    - team logos would be cool
  - player stats would be cool too but not really the point of the tool
